<h1 style='padding-top: 1em;'>Lissajous Curves</h1>

<p>Two oscillations are used to produce a graph called a Lissajous
curve (pronounced Liss-uh-joo).  One oscillation determins the x
coordinate and the other oscillation determines the y coordinate.  In
this demonstration, a third oscillation determines the drawing
color.</p>

<p>When the ratio of the frequencies of the oscillations is a rational
number (i.e. expressible as integers a/b), the curve is closed; it
loops back on itself.  Different ratios produce different shapes.</p>

<h2>Musical Scales</h2>

<p>Sound is an oscillation.  In this demonstration of Lissajous
curves, musical tones are used as the oscillations that produce the
curve.</p>

<p>The various tones of a musical scale are not selected at random.
It was found by many different cultures that if two tones were played
together, the combination would sound pleasant (consonant) in some
cases.  An important source of consonance is when the ratio of the
frequencies (the interval) is expressible as a fraction of low integers
a/b.</p>

<p>The various tones in a scale are traditionally given letters and
names; the ratio of their frequencies to the base tone is given below
for the major C <u>just scale</u>.</p>

<tr><th>DO</th><th>RE</th><th>MI</th><th>FA</th><th>SOL</th><th>LA</th><th>TI</th><th>DO'</th></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C'</td></tr>
<tr class='ratio'><td>1</td><td>9/8</td><td>5/4</td><td>4/3</td><td>3/2</td><td>5/3</td><td>15/8</td><td>2</td></tr>

<p>The just scale is designed to produce intervals that form perfect
ratios with the base tone in the scale.  Other musical scales are
designed with different considerations in mind.  A commonly used
system known as the <u>equal tempered scale</u> does not have perfect
ratios with the base tone, but it has the advantage that any tone in
the scale can be chosen as the base tone while maintaining the same
intervals in the scale and the same set of frequencies to choose from.
In the just scale, on the other hand, the set of frequencies must be
adjusted, depending on which base tone was chosen.  Since many of the
intervals in the equal tempered scale are close but not quite perfect
ratios, the Lissajous curve does not quite loop back on itself as it
does when using frequencies from the just scale.</p>

<p>The ratio of frequencies to the base tone for the major C equal tempered scale are given below.</p>
